It’s possible the cocktail was born out of Prohibition, when thirsty scofflaws wanted to disguise their booze. It’s also possible the drink sprung up in the ’70s at a bar in Long Island, or maybe at a TGI Friday’s. This much is known: You still can’t throw a lemon wedge inside the chain restaurant without knocking one over.\n\nOn paper, the Long Island Iced Tea is one hot mess of a drink. Four different—and disparate—spirits slugging it out in a single glass, along with triple sec, lemon juice and cola? The recipe reads more like a frat-house hazing ritual than one of the world’s most popular cocktails. And yet, somehow, it works.\n\nThat’s because the Long Island Iced Tea succeeds where so many of today’s refined cocktails fall short: It’s boozy AF—nearly four ounces of alcohol against less than half that amount in mixers. Unless you’re a sailor on shore leave (and, probably, even if you are), that’s a red-flag ratio loaded with morning-after consequences. It’s also precisely what a person needs every now and then.\n\nSo, it’s best not to intellectualize the Long Island Iced Tea. Instead, love it for what it is: a one-and-done cocktail that goes down quickly and gets the job done. That said, even though the drink is rarely served at establishments juicing fresh citrus, it really perks up with the addition of fresh lemon juice. If you’re making one at home, squeeze some fruit for an easy win. And if you’re looking to tame your tea a bit, pull back the boozy parts from three-quarter ounce to half-ounce, and lean in on the cola.

The liqueur—and its associated cocktail—spread across the globe, finding a particularly loyal fan base in New Orleans. Combined with ginger ale, lemon juice, cucumber and a medley of fruit garnishes, the drink was a welcome relief from the Southern heat. The Pimm’s Cup is also the favorite cooler at Wimbledon. The first Pimm’s Bar opened in 1971 on the hallowed tennis grounds, and it’s still enjoyed today by the pitcher.\n\nThe Pimm’s Cup is built right in the glass, so it’s very simple to make at home. Simply mix Pimm’s No. 1 with fresh lemon juice and ginger ale and apply your garnishes. With its refreshing taste and modest proof, its a great option for day-drinking, whether you’re watching tennis or enjoying a sunny day on your porch.\n\nTo alter the core formula, you can replace the ginger ale and lemon juice with sparkling lemonade.

The origins of this classic drink can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El Draque. Named for Sir Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer who visited Havana in 1586, El Draque was composed of aguardiente (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar. It was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes, but it’s easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed its flavor and effects.\n\nEventually, rum replaced aguardiente and the name was changed to the Mojito. It’s unclear exactly when this transpired, but the Mojito first appeared in cocktail literature in the 1932 edition of “\nAppropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (the island nation grows sugar cane) are joined together and then lengthened with thirst-quenching club soda to create a delicious, lighthearted cocktail. The drink is traditionally made with unaged white rum, which yields a light, crisp flavor. Using Cuban rum will score you points for authenticity, although many modern Cuban rums are lighter in style than their predecessors, so you might try experimenting with white rums until you find one that you like best.\n\nThe Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, but the end result is worth the effort. The mint combines with the other ingredients for an extra dose of refreshment that, while often associated with summer, can be enjoyed any time of the year\n\nIf you prefer your cocktails with a dash of literary history, you’re in luck.

Their reasoning: The drink’s name refers to the saying “twisting the lion’s tail,” a phrase that describes provoking the British, whose royal coat of arms features a lion.\n\nFeaturing bourbon, allspice dram (a liqueur made with rum, pimento berries and spices), fresh lime juice, simple syrup and aromatic bitters, the Lion’s Tail is an unusual drink that nearly slides into Tiki territory.

Yet for all of its suave simplicity, the drink remains as relevant today as it was when it first captured drinkers’ hearts 200 years ago.\n\nIf you’re a history buff, you could draw a straight line connecting this drink to the first recorded definition of the cocktail category in general (circa 1806), which called for spirits, sugar, water and bitters. The Old Fashioned hits all those marks, with whiskey, sugar, water and aromatic bitters. You could also skip the history lesson and simply make the drink. Do the latter if you’re already thirsty.\n\nStart by using good bourbon, the rule being that if you wouldn’t sip it by itself it has no place at the helm of a Bourbon Old Fashioned.

From there, the cocktail-minded seem to break into two camps: \nWhile a barspoon of syrup can cut your prep time in half, it robs the drink of some of the weight and texture that provides its deep appeal. If you want to make the drink like they did back in the 19th century, granulated sugar or a sugar cube is the way to go. If you want to make the cocktail with more of a modern twist, opt for simple syrup. (Although what’s the big rush? The Bourbon Old Fashioned isn’t going anywhere.) Just know that simple syrup adds a bit more water to your drink, so you may need to adjust your ice and stirring accordingly.\n\nOnce you’ve mastered the Bourbon Old Fashioned, you can also try making the cocktail with rye whiskey, which results in a slightly spicier drink. Or you can use rum, brandy or any number of spirits—after all, the Old Fashioned is more of a template than an exact science.

Often, easy-to-source ingredients combined in simple packages result in the best drinks. Case in point: the Tom Collins, a classic cocktail featuring gin, lemon juice, simple syrup and club soda. The refreshing drink tastes like a spiked sparkling lemonade and is equipped with all you need to cool down on a hot day.\n\nThere’s some debate as to the cocktail’s origin. According to drinks historian David Wondrich, the Tom Collins is strikingly similar to the gin punches being served in London bars during the 19th century. An enterprising barkeep named John Collins named the concoction after himself, whether or not he invented it. But given that the cocktail was typically made with Old Tom gin, drinkers eventually took to requesting Tom rather than John Collinses.\n\nThe Tom Collins was immortalized in Harry Johnson’s 1882 book, “New and Improved Bartender’s Manual: Or How to Mix Drinks of the Present Style.” It remained popular over the decades and is still a prominent drink today, available at bars across the world. You don’t need to visit a bar to drink one, however. As the Tom Collins requires no special tools—not even a shaker or strainer—it’s a snap to make at home. Simply build the drink in a tall glass, add ice and an optional garnish, and you’re done. Take one refreshing sip, and you’ll quickly see why this cocktail lives up to its classic status.\n","ingredients":["2 ounces London Dry gin","1 ounce lemon juice, freshly squeezed","1/2 ounce simple syrup","Club soda, to top","Garnish: lemon wheel","Garnish: maraschino cherry"],"steps":["Add the gin, lemon juice and simple syrup to a Collins glass.","Fill with ice, top with club soda and stir.","Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry (optional)."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:16:45.053Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Rum & Smoke","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/MhTyZpZhtptULnN7K8upmhyQr8s=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__10__14082007__rum-and-smoke-720x720-article-1d9b0c62022f4c30ae78dc7eadb17f72.jpg","body":"\nOn the surface, the Rum & Smoke looks like little more than a winterized rum ","ingredients":["1 1/2 oz Aged rum","3/4 oz Oloroso sherry","1/4 oz Tempus Fugit Gran Classico bitter liqueur","1 barspoon Smoked-rosemary simple syrup*","Garnish: Flamed rosemary sprig"],"steps":["In a mixing glass, add all ingredients with ice and stir until chilled.","Strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice.","Garnish with a flamed rosemary sprig.","Cover with a glass dome and let sit for 1-2 minutes, or until the cocktail is well smoked, before drinking.","*Smoked-rosemary simple syrup: In a saucepan over medium heat, combine 1⁄2 cup sugar, 1⁄2 cup water and zest from 1 orange and stir until just under boil.

In fact, Tepper notes that the cocktail’s most important element is the temperature of those ingredients. Start with cold brandies. Prebatch the brandy blend and store it in the fridge prior to pouring. Meanwhile, house the cider in the fridge at around 38°F to 45°F.\n\nWith regard to the spirit blend, Tepper explains that when chilled it has “a silky and almost weighted texture.” Consider the more viscous texture of vodka chilled in a freezer versus the spirit at room temperature. In addition to mouthfeel, the temperature of the alcohol is important because it affects the cocktail’s dilution. When you pour a room-temperature spirit on ice, the dilution process starts immediately and will lead to a more watered-down highball––a drink that, by nature, is watered-down alcohol. With chilled spirits, the ice will melt more slowly, yielding less dilution in the drink.\n\nTo further prevent dilution, Tepper advocates for a frozen 12-ounce Collins glass. He suggests an ice spear, or two blocks, which should hit about 3 centimeters below the glass’ lip, for aesthetic reasons and so the ice doesn’t slide out and hit the imbiber’s nose or lips upon first sip.\n","ingredients":["1/2 ounce Adrien Camut six-year-old calvados","1/2 ounce St. George apple brandy","1/2 ounce Laird’s bottled-in-bond straight apple brandy","5 ounces Cyril Zangs Ciderman apple cider","Garnish: Meyer lemon twist"],"steps":["Pour the 3 brandies into a frozen Collins glass with ice, and stir for 5 seconds.","Top with the cider.","Garnish with a small Meyer lemon twist."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:16:55.543Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Tom Yum on a Rock","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/ArhftI2Fim2PvyWjDfj95QRdDwE=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tomyumonarock-720x720-primary-a7a6b47f74da43fc914bf0b3cd811323.jpg","body":"\nThere’s nothing quite like this tangy, spicy sipper at \nThis recipe originally appeared as part of “","ingredients":["1 Lime wedge","1 Makrut lime leaf","1 stalk Chopped lemongrass (chopped, hard outer shell removed)","1 oz Fresh lime juice","1 3/4 oz Beluga vodka","2/3 oz Cointreau","2/3 oz Palm sugar syrup (equal parts palm sugar and water, boiled and cooled)","Garnish: Red pepper flakes","Garnish: Sea salt","Garnish: Lime wheel","Garnish: Red chile pepper"],"steps":["Rub the lime wedge on half of the outer rim of a rocks glass, and coat the glass in a mixture of equal-parts red pepper flakes and sea salt and set aside.","Add the makrut lime leaf, lemongrass and lime juice into a shaker and muddle gently.","Add the vodka, Cointreau, syrup and ice and shake until well-chilled.","Double-strain into the prepared glass over fresh ice.","Garnish with a lime wheel and red chile pepper on a bamboo pick."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:16:56.688Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Bear With Me, Honey","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/86n4O9QMFLxeEZX17nq_wQa5YVo=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2020__01__21103624__Bear-With-Me-Honey-at-A-Rakes-Progress-courtesy-of-Sydell-Group_article_720x720-85ab120897cb43b89a68c49299f4a6a0.jpg","body":"\nA riff on a \nIt isn’t quite wine, yet verjus also isn’t grape juice as we know it.

The origins of this classic drink can be traced to Cuba and the 16th-century cocktail El Draque. Named for Sir Francis Drake, the English sea captain and explorer who visited Havana in 1586, El Draque was composed of aguardiente (a cane-spirit precursor to rum), lime, mint and sugar. It was supposedly consumed for medicinal purposes, but it’s easy to believe that drinkers enjoyed its flavor and effects.\n\nEventually, rum replaced aguardiente and the name was changed to the Mojito. It’s unclear exactly when this transpired, but the Mojito first appeared in cocktail literature in the 1932 edition of “\nAppropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (the island nation grows sugar cane) are joined together and then lengthened with thirst-quenching club soda to create a delicious, lighthearted cocktail. The drink is traditionally made with unaged white rum, which yields a light, crisp flavor. Using Cuban rum will score you points for authenticity, although many modern Cuban rums are lighter in style than their predecessors, so you might try experimenting with white rums until you find one that you like best.\n\nThe Mojito is slightly more labor-intensive than other cocktails because it involves muddling the mint, but the end result is worth the effort. The mint combines with the other ingredients for an extra dose of refreshment that, while often associated with summer, can be enjoyed any time of the year\n\nIf you prefer your cocktails with a dash of literary history, you’re in luck.

The drink was supposedly so popular with its intended audience that troops telegrammed the hotel asking for bulk orders of this liquid fortification to be made and delivered to the front lines. Such a move puts your making this at home and drinking it on your couch in perspective.\n\nToday, the common recipe calls for bourbon and gin, though some reports peg the original as containing brandy instead of bourbon. Both spirits make excellent versions of the drink, but this recipe sticks with whiskey. If you can’t find ginger beer, ginger ale also works. The resulting cocktail won’t be quite as spicy, but it will still contain a thirst-quenching, effervescent quality.\n\nInterestingly, the Suffering Bastard took a left turn in the 1960s, when it became associated with Tiki culture. Recipes of the period, including one by Trader Vic, began to feature rums as the base spirits, accented by orgeat and curaçao liqueur. But if you want to make the original recipe, skip the rum.\n\nWhichever route you go, this cocktail has stuck around for a reason: It will take away your suffering (although too many of these bastards has been known to increase it).

It was meant to be a healing drink, equal parts practicality and magic, and most likely served warm, with ingredients from the field that were easily accessible, like sugar cane, lime and honey—a \nMy grandmother was pretty sheltered growing up. She left Cuba as a young wife and mom in the 1960s and never looked back. In times of illness, the answer to everything for her was (and still is) Vicks VapoRub, an American topical solution with menthol and eucalyptus. No wonder she’d never heard of Canchánchara.

It’s refreshing but packs a punch and will get you dancing in no time,” says Natalie.\n\nFounded by the Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, Trinidad prospered during the colonial period, growing rich from the labor of enslaved Africans working on sugar plantations. Wealthy European landowners built many historically preserved buildings, securing Trinidad's status as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1988. It’s a town where most bars serve Canchánchara, with some recipes utilizing aguardiente, or “firewater.” Essentially, it’s just rum in its most stripped down state—sugar cane juice that has been fermented and contains anywhere from 29% to 60% alcohol by volume.\n\n“I do know that the drink was pre-colonial and enjoyed by the native Taino people,” says Natalie. “I’ve heard they used to drink it out of gourds, but there’s a family of potters that now make the cups out of clay in the shape of a gourd. They are sixth-generation potters in Trinidad.”\n\nThe pots are referred to as copas de barro, minus the base or the stem. One man, known throughout the village as just Chichi, is a master potter who handcrafts the clay mugs with no handles and then makes and proudly serves the cocktail to guests himself. But he’s not the only one. There’s an entire bar in Trinidad devoted to the drink, and with a name like Taberna La Canchánchara, it can’t possibly be a bust. Plus, there’s live salsa music at Taberna and almost everywhere you turn in this oft-overlooked town.\n\nI think it’s important to note that creative liberties can be taken when making this cocktail, as long as it doesn’t stray too far from the original and whether its sole purpose is to cure you of an ailment or get you on the dance floor.\n","ingredients":["1 1/2 ounces aguardiente or white rum","1 lime, freshly squeezed","1/2 ounce honey syrup","1 splash club soda","Garnish: lime wedge"],"steps":["Add the rum, juice of one lime and honey syrup into a shaker with ice, and shake until well-chilled.","Strain into a clay or glass mug filled with fresh ice.","Top with a splash of club soda.","Garnish with a lime wedge."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:17:41.233Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Daiquiri","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/tEtuxTTrxHz4RG3sqTHlsdVRWOI=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2018__04__23143458__daiquiri-720x720-recipe-09f1d5665a794eddbbfb997876736136.jpg","body":"\nThe Daiquiri was supposedly invented in 1898 in the eponymous mining town of Daiquiri on the southeastern tip of Cuba by an American mining engineer named Jennings Cox.

Cachaça is also the country’s national spirit, inextricably tying this drink to its home.\n\nFirst made in the 1500s, cachaça is similar to rum, but it has a flavor all its own.

Even as the sweet, frozen drink heyday of the ’80s and ’90s has waned, tropical drinks continue to dominate beaches and resort hotels for good reason—they’re fun, delicious reminders that you’re on vacation.\n\nTo make the Miami Vice, you need to make two separate cocktails. The \nNow that you have two drinks at your disposal, you, of course, combine them. Whichever order you choose will taste great, but the typical presentation involves red at the bottom and white up top, so you pour the Strawberry Daiquiri into the glass first, followed by the Piña Colada. The layered effect creates a striking visual and gives the drinker a choose-your-own-adventure situation. Sip from the bottom, and you’ll taste mostly Daiquiri. Sip from the top, and it’s all coconut-y. Mix them together, and enjoy the synergistic blend created by two of the world’s most popular tropical cocktails. There are no wrong answers here.\n\nThat said, you may feel tempted to set the blender blades spinning with ready-made mixes. Resist that urge. If you stick to fresh fruits, freshly squeezed juice and good rum, your Miami Vice will be a runaway hit, both in taste and appearance. Yes, just like the television show famous for its white jackets, V-necks and loafers.\n","ingredients":["2 ounces rum, divided","1 cup strawberries, chopped with stems removed","1 ounce lime juice, freshly squeezed","1/2 ounce simple syrup","2 ounces cream of coconut","2 ounces pineapple juice","Garnish: pineapple slice"],"steps":["In a blender, add 1 oz rum, the strawberries, the lime juice, the simple syrup and 1 cup crushed ice and blend until smooth.","Pour into a hurricane glass and set in the freezer.","Wash and dry the blender thoroughly.","In the clean blender, add the remaining 1 oz rum, the cream of coconut, the pineapple juice and 1 cup crushed ice and blend until smooth.","Pour into the hurricane glass that already contains the Strawberry Daiquiri, creating a layered effect.","Garnish with a pineapple slice."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:17:58.537Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Zombie","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/UkU6Dis_8EXN3cpuKVJhkQLbFms=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2016__06__15161058__zombie-720x720-recipe-3d4b027436704e078d69c46922a4868e.jpg","body":"\nThe Zombie is a classic Tiki drink by legendary bartender and restaurateur Donn Beach, of Don the Beachcomber.

The result is a silky, crystal-clear drink—Rockey’s bottled liqueur version removes all the legwork from the mix, and the cocktail possibilities are seemingly endless. This one, for example, combines Rockey’s with rum, pineapple and fresh lime juice for a refreshing swizzle likely to convert any skeptic.\n\n“The versatility of clarified milk punch is unmatched,” says wine and spirits writer and expert Shanika Hillocks. “In my opinion, Rockey’s is a sophisticated nod to BYOB because any spirit can be incorporated and all palates can enjoy it.” Depending on the cocktail’s variables, Hillocks notes that one can easily coax out a range of different flavors from the liqueur, from floral and fruity to tart citrus and soft nuttiness.\n\nWhat’s great about the Rockey’s & Rum Swizzle (aside from the obvious) is that it’s built directly inside the glass—an easy and straightforward style that minimizes the amount of dishes left to clean afterward.

According to cocktail historian and writer \nEventually the recipe evolved into a whole range of drinks, though the general format remained—usually a dark spirit like rum, brandy or whiskey is mixed with citrus or other fruit juices, some kind of sweetener, often a wine and sometimes tea. The Port Royal Punch, on the other hand, borrows from the modern idea of a “fruit punch,” as it uses a considerable amount of juice. And rather than something like a sparkling wine, its carbonation comes from that ubiquitous of citrus sodas: Sprite. A bit of grenadine makes it even sweeter, though using a homemade grenadine keeps it from being too cloying.\n\nUnlike a recipe from Wondrich’s book on punch, the Port Royal would be more likely found at a college party, or maybe a club, than it would be on the bar top of a cocktail lounge. Spiced rum, pineapple and mango juice, sprite and grenadine are not commonplace ingredients in modern craft cocktails. However, if you’re hosting a party for friends who want something a little sweeter, something that hides its alcoholic content amongst fruit juices and sodas, and something that you’re more in danger of contracting a sugar high over than getting too drunk from, then it’s sure to be a party pleaser.\n\nOne of the key aspects to punch is its presentation. The most obvious bit of presentation is the punch bowl itself. These days, it’s surprisingly easy to find ornate, stunning examples both online and at vintage shops. While you can always use a regular old mixing bowl, besides its relatively underwhelming appearance compared to something ornate, it’s difficult to find one that fits the volume of the Port Royal Punch. The other alternative is a large pitcher, and again, it’s an opportunity to get ornate.\n\nThe other key ingredient for both ","ingredients":["1 750-milliliter bottle Captain Morgan spiced rum","96 ounces pineapple juice","24 ounces mango juice","12 ounces Sprite","4 1/2 ounces grenadine","3 oranges, sliced thinly and quartered"],"steps":["Combine all ingredients in a punch bowl and stir to combine.","Serve in punch glasses filled with ice."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:18:11.629Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Mary Pickford","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/Ub7CGzvngatxRJdS6UFCAj8lSbM=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/mary-pickford-720x720-primary-d3a86684af4b42bfb7c90074135aec24.jpg","body":"\nSweet but with a real kick, just like its ","ingredients":["1 1/2 ounces white rum","1 1/2 ounces pineapple juice","1 tsp grenadine","6 drops maraschino liqueur"],"steps":["Add all the ingredients to a cocktail shaker and fill with ice.","Shake, and strain into a chilled cocktail glass."],"author":"System","authorRef":"6076c3e4d145df5910a70ac8","createdAt":"2021-04-14T12:18:13.254Z","likes":[],"comments":[]},{"title":"Mango Basil Lemonade","image":"https://www.liquor.com/thmb/hCFMiZ4mgzG83gN_FCfdsAi7MBk=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/__opt__aboutcom__coeus__resources__content_migration__liquor__2019__06__26144932__HY_VS_MangoBasilLemonade_1_720x720-8f29ad476fee459f98df8cd8a184b596.png","body":"\nThis simple and refreshing recipe brings together Hennessy V.S. cognac with an inspired pair of ingredients: mango and basil.

The most credible version attributes the cocktail to Joe Sheridan, the head chef of the restaurant at the \nThe drink was later made famous by Pulitzer Prize-winning \"San Francisco Chronicle\" columnist Stanton Delaplane, who frequented the \nAccording to bartending legend Dale DeGroff, the Irish Coffee should not be a large drink. He says that bars, particularly in America, go too big, which ruins the balance of an otherwise great cocktail. \"Choose the vessel wisely,\" he says. \"The small bell-shaped glass that Libbey has been providing to The Buena Vista for decades is a nice size at six ounces.\"\n\nThen you can build your drink right in the glass, starting with the whiskey, sugar and coffee, and topping it with a dose of thick cream. \"At The Buena Vista Cafe, the concoction is finished with a white cloud of hand-whipped cream,\" says DeGroff. \"This topping serves two important purposes: It creates the drink’s signature dramatic black-and-white look, and the unsweetened coolness of the cream tempers the alcohol and the hot, sugary coffee.\" If you’d like to decorate that gorgeous white head, you can optionally add a dusting of fresh cinnamon or nutmeg for a fragrant garnish.\n\n\"You also don’t need a giant pour of Irish whiskey,\" says DeGroff. \"Delaplane and Koeppler’s recipe calls for a one-ounce shot. I know it seems stingy, but do not be put off—it’s actually good news. That liquor, along with three-and-a-half ounces of steaming-hot sweetened coffee and three-quarters of an inch of lightly whipped cream, is so delicious you’ll want to consume at least two more.\" Liquor.com’s recipe below calls for slightly more than that, but it's still not enough to knock you off your bar stool.\n\nDegroff offers three additional tips for creating a perfect Irish Coffee:\n\n1. Use a stemmed glass no larger than eight ounces. (With an eight-ounce glass, you can go up to one-and-a-half ounces of Irish whiskey. I am partial to Jameson.)\n\n2.

Legend has it that Kate Moss asked for a drink that would “wake me up and then f**k me up” at the same time. He complied, mixing vodka with espresso and coffee liqueur, and the Espresso Martini was born.\n\nIf you have an espresso machine, you can pull a shot and put it in the freezer for a quick chill.

The recipe can vary depending on who’s making it, but the basic formula consists of eggs, sugar, milk and cream, plus a spirit. For the latter, most people turn to bourbon, rum or brandy, and some even elect to combine a couple spirits for oomph. Whichever route you choose, the potency of this drink will put a little more cheer in your holidays.\n\nEggnog has a rich history with a lot of competing claims as to the origin of the drink, many of which get lost in an etymological debate. It’s possible the word derives from an Old English term for strong beer. Or maybe it comes from noggin, an outdated word used to describe a small cup. Or perhaps the name aligns with grogs, the term given to a variety of alcoholic drinks.\n\nThat said, it’s believed that the first known use of the word “Eggnog” dates to around 1775, but it’s likely that the drink itself—or a version of it—preceded the term by a couple hundred years. And there seems to be consensus that Eggnog as we know it today is a culinary descendant of \nIn Europe, ale was eventually replaced by sherry. By the time the drink reached American shores, colonists replaced sherry with what they had on hand: rum, rye whiskey and brandy. Those early iterations of the cocktail had staying power, and today, Eggnog is still widely consumed throughout the U.S. and even into Canada. It’s especially popular during the holiday season and can be consumed hot or cold, per the drinker’s preference—and perhaps depending on how brisk the weather outside is.\n\nRegardless of the cocktail’s origin or which spirit is best suited to the creamy mixture, everyone can agree on this: Eggnog is a universally delicious beverage with the capacity to improve any holiday gathering.

According to cocktail historian and writer \nEventually the recipe evolved into a whole range of drinks, though the general format remained—usually a dark spirit like rum, brandy or whiskey is mixed with citrus or other fruit juices, some kind of sweetener, often a wine and sometimes tea. The Port Royal Punch, on the other hand, borrows from the modern idea of a “fruit punch,” as it uses a considerable amount of juice. And rather than something like a sparkling wine, its carbonation comes from that ubiquitous of citrus sodas: Sprite. A bit of grenadine makes it even sweeter, though using a homemade grenadine keeps it from being too cloying.\n\nUnlike a recipe from Wondrich’s book on punch, the Port Royal would be more likely found at a college party, or maybe a club, than it would be on the bar top of a cocktail lounge. Spiced rum, pineapple and mango juice, sprite and grenadine are not commonplace ingredients in modern craft cocktails. However, if you’re hosting a party for friends who want something a little sweeter, something that hides its alcoholic content amongst fruit juices and sodas, and something that you’re more in danger of contracting a sugar high over than getting too drunk from, then it’s sure to be a party pleaser.\n\nOne of the key aspects to punch is its presentation. The most obvious bit of presentation is the punch bowl itself. These days, it’s surprisingly easy to find ornate, stunning examples both online and at vintage shops.
